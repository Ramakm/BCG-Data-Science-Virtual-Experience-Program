<h1 style position = 'center'> BCG: Data Science Virtual Experience Program</h1>
Welcome to the Data Science
We recognize that these tasks are challenging and that there are undoubtedly phrases and terminology you may not have heard before – don’t worry! We have tried to make this experience as true to life as possible and therefore our ask is that you attempt to seek out independent sources of information and do your own research, as required, to help guide you through the tasks.
 
Welcome to the Data Science program! BCG X is transforming the businesses of today through data science and advanced analytics initiatives and our goal is to help companies generate competitive advantage through these initiatives. This module is designed to give you a feel of what it is like to work at BCG X as we help our clients using data science.

Our client for this project is PowerCo, a major utilities company. PowerCo has had declining profits due to significant customer churn. We have been engaged to drive churn reduction within their Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) customers.

As a BCG X Data Scientist, you can expect to work in many different industries, and on many different types of business challenges. The skills you will use and develop today are part of the consultant and data scientist toolkits, and will be applicable to many different types of cases.
We hope you will enjoy your virtual experience and get a glimpse into the exciting life of a Data Scientist at BCG X!

# **Task-1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing**

## **Background information of the task**

PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price, for which a good predictive model could be useful.
Moreover, for those customers that are at risk of churning, a discount might incentivize them to stay with our client. The head of the SME division is considering a 20% discount that is considered large enough to dissuade almost anyone from churning (especially those for whom price is the primary concern).
The Associate Director (AD) held an initial team meeting to discuss various hypotheses, including churn due to price sensitivity. After discussion with your team, you have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities. 
Your AD wants an email with your thoughts on how the team should go about testing this hypothesis. The client plans to use the predictive model on the 1st working day of every month to indicate to which customers the 20% discount should be offered.

## **Tasks:**
1. Understand what is going on with the client and to think about how you would approach this problem and test the specific hypothesis.
2. You must formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis.
3. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email to your AD, focusing on the data that you would need from the client and the analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.

**If you are stuck:**
1. Remember what the key factors are for a customer deciding to stay with or switch providers
2. Think of data sources and fields that could be used to explore the contribution of various factors to a customer’s possible action 
3. Ideally, what would a data frame of your choice look like – what should each column and row represent? 
4. What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more insights about the customer's churn behavior?
